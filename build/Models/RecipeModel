Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking the rest. Simmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds. You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée. Put the cream and yoghurt in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream further, so don’t take it too far. When the purée is completely cold, adjust the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly combined. Spoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes – or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don’t over-stir it.

                   For the carrot cake, preheat the oven to 180C/170C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line a deep, 20cm/8in round cake tin with baking paper. Break the eggs into a large bowl, and lightly whisk using a fork. Add the vegetable oil and whisk again. Stir in the grated carrots, raisins, walnut pieces, and orange zest. In a separate large bowl, sift together the flour, mixed spice, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Stir in the sugar. Add the wet carrot mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well to combine, making sure there are no pockets of flour. Spoon the cake batter into the lined tin and bake on the middle shelf for 1–1¼ hours, until the cake has risen and is golden-brown all over. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside in the tin to cool for 10–15 minutes, then turn the cake out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.
                   While the carrot cake cools, make the frosting. Place the softened butter in a large bowl with the caster sugar, beat it for 2–3 minutes until light and creamy, then stir in the cream cheese until smooth. Place the cake on a serving plate or cake stand. Use a palette knife, or flat-bladed knife, to spread the frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Scatter more walnuts on the top and serve.

                   To make the red wine jelly, put the red wine, jam sugar, star anise, clove, cinnamon stick, allspice, split vanilla pod, and seeds in a medium saucepan.

Will keep in the fridge for up to 1 month. Take the pastry out of the fridge and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes, then unroll. Heat the grill to high and heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cut out 2 x 13cm circles of pastry, using a plate as a guide, and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tbsp sugar and grill for 5 minutes to caramelize, watching carefully so that the sugar doesn’t burn. Remove from the grill. Peel, quarter, and core the apples, cut into 2mm-thin slices and arrange on top of the pastry. Sprinkle over the remaining sugar and pop in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the pastry is cooked through and golden, and the apples are softened. Remove and allow to cool slightly. Warm 3 tbsp of the red wine jelly in a small pan over a low heat with 1 tsp water to make it a little more runny, then brush over the top of the tarts. Tip the crème fraîche into a bowl, sift over the icing sugar and cardamom, and mix together. Carefully lift the warm tarts onto serving plates and serve with the cardamom crème fraîche.

                   First, make the pastry. Tip the ingredients into a food processor with ¼ tsp salt. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the pastry from the fridge and leave at room temperature for 5 minutes to soften. Flour the work surface, then unwrap the pastry and roll it to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin. Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no gaps. Leave 1cm pastry overhanging. Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first) and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 minutes until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes until golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps.
                   Meanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup, and sugars into a pan, and add ¼ tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 minutes. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Beat the eggs in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla, and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake for 50-55 minutes until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill for at least 2 hours before serving.

Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don’t wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr. Let the pudding sit for 5 mins before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.",

               50g butter, cut into small pieces, plus 15g/½oz melted
               100g light muscovado sugar

               Step 1:
               Heat oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5. Butter a wide shallow ovenproof dish. Blend the cornflour with the orange zest and juice, and put in a large pan with the sugar. Halve, stone, and slice the peaches and add to the pan. Bring slowly to the boil, stirring gently until the sauce is shiny and thickened, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the blueberries, and tip into the prepared dish.
               
               Step 2:
               Tip the flour into a mixing bowl and add the 50g butter. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in half the sugar. Mix the remaining sugar with the cinnamon and set aside.
               
               Step 3:
               Add the milk to the dry ingredients and mix to a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll out to an oblong roughly 16 x 24cm. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle evenly with the spicy sugar. Roll up from one long side and cut into 12 slices. Arrange around the top of the dish, leaving the center uncovered.
               
               Step 4:
               Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the topping is crisp and golden. Serve warm.

Crush the biscuits by bashing them in a bag with a rolling pin, then stir them into the butter until very well coated. Press the mixture firmly into the base of the tin and chill.
