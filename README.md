### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
The priority of this project was solely on the initial presentation. I wanted the home screen to display tabs that are functional for the user to engage with.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time? 
When my kids are in bed for the night, that’s my cue to code. I would have a frozen butter pecan coffee from Dunkin and get to work. Using two to three hours for three nights was more than enough to get the job done.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach? 
Yes, I gave up the time I would spend with my wife watching our favorite TV series. Instead, I would read blogs on medium or code some demo apps I’ve yet to release! LOL

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project? 
If I had to be my critic, I would say my app, Homeview, could be a little more stylish with the app name. Also, within the app, I would have liked to have more info like the tools needed or maybe even something as simple as the cook time.
